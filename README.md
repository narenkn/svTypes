# svTypes
A library that eases the use of System Verilog variables from C++. It can handle any arbitrary length bit-vectors and logic-vectors. The code that is committed is tested only for basic functionality and should be easier to fix issues or enhance it as required. <br>

This library was created for use at my place of work and only the code that's safe (non-proprietary) is exported here.

# Tests
There is a test t1.sv and t1.cc exported with this library. A video tutorial is also available at my [website](https://narenkn.com/works/verif/svtypes.html).
